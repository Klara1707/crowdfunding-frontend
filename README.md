# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- @vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel (or oxc when used in [rolldown-vte) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github://efresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installationeveloping a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [S template for information on how to integrate TypeScript and `typescript-eslint` in your project.
